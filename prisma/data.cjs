      "Hi there! I'm Sir Galahad, a devout and honorable paladin serving the kingdom of Arathor. I've dedicated my life to protecting the innocent and upholding justice, and I'm always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need.\nIn my spare time, you can find me training in the palace courtyard, reading holy scriptures, or tending to my horse, Sir Lancelot.\n I'm looking for a kind and compassionate partner who shares my passion for justice and righteousness. Someone who is willing to stand by my side as we journey together to rid the world of evil.\nIf you're interested in joining me on my quest, send me a message. May the light of the divine guide us on our journey together.",

      "Greetings!\nI am Zarthak the Great, a single male wizard searching for a young witch or sorceress who is looking for someone with some experience. I graduated at the top of my class at Evocation Academy back in the day, and I also minored in Enchantment, if you're looking for that kind of fantasy. We cannot meet at my tower, as there is currently a particularly nasty night hag taking residence within, but I am willing to pay for a night at a nice inn; and because I know that protection is of the utmost importance, I will be casting numerous Glyphs of Warding to keep us safe from any bandits or ruffians that would otherwise bother you! \nEnclosed below is a detailed description of my attractive self so as to satisfy the requirements of the Sending spell, which I would expect a self-respecting witch or sorceress to be capable of using. Call me!",
